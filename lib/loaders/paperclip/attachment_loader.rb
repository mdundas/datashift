      # 
      # Options 
      #
      # => :attach_to_klass    
      #       A class that has a relationship with the attachment (has_many, has_one or belongs_to etc)  
      #       The instance of :attach_to_klass can be searched for and the new attachment assigned.
      #       
      #     Examples     
      #       Owner has_many pdfs and mp3 files as Digitals .... :attach_to_klass = Owner
      #       User has a single image used as an avatar ... :attach_to_klass = User
      #
      # => :attach_to_find_by_field    
      #       For the :attach_to_klass, this is the field used to search for the parent
      #       object to assign the new attachment to.
      #       
      #     Examples     
      #       Owner has a unique 'name' field ... :attach_to_find_by_field = :name
      #       User has a unique  'login' field  ... :attach_to_klass = :login
      #
      # => :attach_to_field    
      #       Attribute/association to assign attachment to on :attach_to_klass.
      #      Examples
      #      
      #         :attach_to_field => digitals  : Owner.digitals = attachment
      #         :attach_to_field => avatar    : User.avatar = attachment
